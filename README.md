# the-definitive-todo-list

the definitive todo list is an application for you to store your notes. You can add related information, date and category to the note. Also you can edit and delete it. 

## how to run

there are two folders in this repo you need to run to get the app working. 

first, we need to install and run our backend in the backend folder.

backend was made with NestJS app, an NodeJS framework.

after you download the repository, write in the terminal:

```
cd backend
```

this will go to backend folder. you also will need to install dependencies.

```
npm i
```

everything going ok, we can run the app:
 
```
npm run start
```

Now, we'll need to install and run our frontend too

```
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```
